    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the very reciple <strong>notorious</strong> in my friend group. Throughout high school I would sell these bad boys for $1 a pop, and I would <em>rake in the dough!</em></p>
    <p>The <strong>crisp caramelized edges</strong> deliciously complemeneted the <strong>ooey-gooey center</strong>, and my customers would always line up in my 1st period at the break of dawn for a taste.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted and cooled to room temperature <em>(8 oz/226g)</em></li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups packed light brown sugar <em>(9 oz/250g)</em></li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar <em>(6 oz/175g)</em></li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour <em>(10.5 oz/300g)</em></li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips, divided</li>
        <li>Flaky sea salt, for topping (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk the flour, salt, and baking soda in a medium bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Whisk brown and white sugar in a large bowl and make sure to break up any large chunks with your fingers if needed. Add the melted butter and whisk vigorously for about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Whisk in one egg to the sugar-butter mixture at a time, stirring until it’s fully mixed in. Whisk in the second egg and the vanilla and scrape the sides of bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the dry ingredients to the wet and stir with the spatula to fully combine. Stir in 1 cup of the chocolate chips and save the other cup for putting on top after baking.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375ºF.</li>
        <li>Scoop out dough into cookie dough balls. I like to make big cookies so I use 1/4 cup to scoop out the dough. Place on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Refrigerate dough for at least 15 minutes while the oven heats up.</li>
        <li>Bake the cookie 3 inches apart on a parchment paper lined baking sheet for 10 to 14 minutes. Remove from oven when the edges are set and the cookie is beginning to turn golden brown throughout.</li>
        <li>Top the cookies with extra chocolate chips and flaky sea salt. Let cool on the sheet for 1-2 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
